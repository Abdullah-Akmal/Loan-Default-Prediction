# Loan Default Prediction

## Description  
This notebook focuses on building a classification model to predict loan defaults based on customer demographic and financial information. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training multiple models to identify high-risk loan applicants and reduce financial risk for lenders.  
**[Dataset Source â€“ (custom or Kaggle-based)]**

## Objectives  
- Analyze borrower data to uncover patterns associated with loan defaults  
- Engineer relevant features and handle missing values  
- Train classification models to predict default risk  
- Evaluate models using key performance metrics  

## Methodology / Steps  
- Load and inspect the dataset for structure, types, and missing values  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Encode categorical variables and scale numeric features  
- Train and evaluate models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
- Use confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for performance assessment  
- Interpret model results to support credit risk management  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, StandardScaler, classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score)
